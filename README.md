# Drawing-Figures-using-Design-Patterns
A standalone desktop application made using Java Swing UI to create figures like circles and rectangles on canvas. 
The project demonstrates the use of different design patterns like  Controller, Expert, Observer, Adaptor, Iterator, Composite and Command.

To run the application --> Run the file MainAppToRun.java

Click on "Circle" or "Box" button on left side panel and then clicking anywhere on the canvas present in right-side panel.

After creating figures, you can click on "Undo" to remove the recently created figure --> This works exactly like Ctrl+Z.

Also, you can click on "Redo" to recreate the recently created figure --> This works exactly like Ctrl+Y.

Below are the design patterns used in this project throughout -

--> Controller Pattern (Creating controller class to perform user actions)

--> Expert Pattern (Handling modal objects)

--> Observer Pattern (eg: Java Action Listener API)

--> Adaptor Pattern (Creating a common class to work with 2 different interfaces)


--> Iterator Pattern (Simply using Java's Iterator class methods to iterate over collections)
--> Composite Pattern (Creating a hiehrachical structure of similar functioning objects)

--> Command Pattern (To encapsulate all the data and operations in object for a user command and decoupling producer-consumer)
